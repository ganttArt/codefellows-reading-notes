# Readings: Ethics

Review at least one article from both “Ethics in the workplace” and “Ethics in Technology” sections below and write how each of them relates to ethics in technology. Do you agree or disagree with these articles? What stuck out to you specifically from each article?

For each article that you choose, write a minimum 5 sentences (1 paragraph). Each reflection should be something of substance and of an acceptable quality.

### Ethics in the workplace

- [The code I’m still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

My reflections: The author advised that at some point in our career, we will most likely be asked to build something that is ethically questionable. In the case of the author, building a quiz where all routes pointed to young girls taking the client's drug had major impacts on the developers life. As he saw girls committing suicide as a result of the drug, he felt personally responsible for the role he played in it. No obviously it is not on him, that these girls committed suicide. If it was not him, it probably would have been someone else to build it... unless perhaps he discussed the ethical questionability of designing a 'quiz' this way with his manager. Now there's no way of guaranteeing that this would have actually made a difference as to whether or not this quiz was built. But one thing that we can be sure of is our own choices. Moving forward to build this technology instead of fighting it, negatively impacted the author's life in a huge way. So as I move forward in writing code, I do not want to find myself in the position where I know the thing I am building is ethically unsound, and then I have to deal with the personal decision to build it for the rest of my life. There are always work-arounds where I can get out of a project that I feel is unethical. Whether it is as simple as talking to my manager about getting out of the project, or to having the higher-ups fully question what they're being asked to build, or all the way to bringing it up to law enforcement, something can always be done and I have a choice as the role I will play in it.

### Ethics in Technology

- [Self Driving Car Ethics](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/)

My reflections: There are clearly some ethical questions that are being dismissed by automakers developing automated cars. Some of these ethical questions are one's that could be debated for centuries by philosophers with no clear right answer, but still need to be decided on by lawmakers. Ultimately, what is important for me as a developer is the role I might play in this. If I move into that field and work in machine learning in particular, it does come down to the engineer to supervise the ML algorithm, if that is the way the algorithm has been designed, it is totally possible they are being designed to be unsupervised. Part of me considers, that casualties will have to happen as we dive into a new world where self-driving cars are the norm. Each incident will bring up ethical considerations and the courts will begin to make decisions to shape the rules that these cars will have to conform to. Nearing the end of the article, they discussed AI beating grandmasters at Go and Chess, using unorthodox moves to win. This is a curious proposition when applied to cars, but often the media sees AI as something that is uncontrollable. ML algorithms do take on a life of their own, but ultimately it is a programmer who has the ability to change these algorithms if something is off. We will learn from these unorthodox things a car will do and maybe we will evolve from what the cars actually learn about driving on the road. New technology can be scary, especially when lives are potentially at stake, but these technologies have a possibility to greatly improve the lives of people. We must push through the fear, stay calm and move forward in the way that seems most ethical and best for humanity.
