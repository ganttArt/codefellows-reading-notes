1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.

Takeaways:

- Don't do thankless work for ungrateful takers that don't deserve your time and energy
- Don't be busy for the sake of being busy, duh.
- Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.
- If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such. But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.
- “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet

### [How to think like a programmer](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)

What to do when you encounter a new problem:

- Understand the problem: Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.
- Plan your solution with exact steps
- Break the problem into sub-problems
- The best programmers are more curious about bugs than irritated by them
  - When you're stuck: debug, reasses and research

Finally: If you practice and you will get better at solving problems.

- You could be more successful if you don't concern yourself with failure.
- More people succeeded at a problem if they were not penalized for failing.
- The Super Mario Effect: Focusin gon the Princess and not the pits, to stick with a task and learn more
- The focus was beating the game, not focusing on everytime you fell in a pit, and you eventually got better
- You need to want to solve the problem. You shouldn't feel like you have to endure everything to just succeed. You shouldn't force yourself to be an optimist. You should work on problems that you want to solve!
- Successes feel better when you've strugged and failed your way there.
