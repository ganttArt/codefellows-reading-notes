# PURPOSE PRACTICE SHEET

## PINPOINT YOUR VALUES

To investigate what’s truly important to you, answer the questions below (expanded from a set in Life Reimagined, Berrett-Koehler, 2013). Take your time. Go from your gut. And write them down on the back.

1. What motivates me to get up in the morning?
    - The idea that I’m working on or towards something meaningful
2. What keeps me up at night?
    - The violence that is done to others.
3. What am I doing when I’m at my best?
    - Exploring, freely and without pressure
4. Why am I bothered by what bothers me?
    - Because injustice is unacceptable
5. Why do I do the work I do?
    - Because technology has the potential, and it has shown itself, as a mechanism to change the world.
6. Why do I live where I live?
    - Because I love being outdoors, playing on the beach and being in an environment that makes me feel at peace.
7. Why do I buy what I buy?
    - Because I am connected to what I buy. As we learned in the video, my limbic system is feeling out what it desires.
8. Why do I long for what I long for?
    - Becuase it means a better life for me and potentially for others
9. Why do I read and watch what I do?
    - Because it inspires me, wiskes me away ito a world of imagination, or is just purely entertaining.
10. Why do I admire whom I admire?
    - Because they do things that inspire me to be a better person or show me something that I never believed possible.
11. When am I happy?
    - When I feel connected to others. When I succeed. When I experience something new and delightful. When I re-experience something that I love.
12. Why do I have the relationships that I have?
    - Because they support me and they heighten the experience that I have on this planet.

## FILTER BY PURPOSE

When you’re feeling out of sorts about what’s going on in your life, or if you’re trying to decide if a new opportunity fits your purpose, use these questions to filter through to an answer.

- What core value does this fit with?
- What level of excitement do I have about this?
- Will/does this distract from something else that is very important to me?
- How might this play out in the future?
