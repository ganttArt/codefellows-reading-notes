# Reading: Component Based UI

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
    - Angular
    - Vue
    - Sencha Ext JS
    - Ember
    - Svelte
1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
    - In a framework, you have to conform to the rules of building within that framework. With a library you can use whatever tools you want that are included in it, in whatever way you want to.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **Rendering** - the creation of a visual representation of data. [src](https://www.quora.com/What-does-rendering-mean-in-computer-science-and-why-is-this-word-used-to-describe-what-it-means)
- **Templates** - a generic class or other unit of source code that can be used as the basis for unique units of code. [src](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/template#:~:text=In%20programming%2C%20a%20template%20is,individual%20template%20classes%20to%20modify.)
- **State** - the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. [src](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-state-react/)

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    - Declaritive vs. imperative. React is Declarative and that is a good upgrade from previous js frameworks, because it is actually making the code easier to read and work with.
    - React continually re-renders html/jsx elements, not just hides them. If you have to force the page to reload, you're doing something wrong.
    - Why people think React is so much better than anything else. When considering the history of React, you can see that React comes up as a way to improve what was the current development using JS frameworks and libraries like jquery, angular and even just vanilla js.
1. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    - Why and when to use SASS.
    - More about the difference between declarative and imperative. I got a good introduction today but I want to double down on it to get a clearer picture.
    - Changing state of a great-grandparent component from the great grandchild.
1. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    - Using SASS instead of CSS.
