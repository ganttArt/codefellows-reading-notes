### [CSS Transitions & Animations](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

- This is a good and large resource that can be used to explore ways to use transitions and animations.
- Transitions are a way to smoothly move between two desired points. Transitions can only work on properties that have an identifiable halfway point. Colors and font sizes are examples that work.
- Animations in css use keyframes to define how the thing you're animating will look at every specific point in time.

8 transitions to make hover or click more engaging.

- Fade in: changing opacity from .5 to 1 on hover
- change color on hover
- grow item on hover with `transform: scale(1.3);` or shrink with a number under 1
- rotate with `transform: rotateZ(-30deg);`
- square to circle: `border-radius: 50%;` on hover
- 3d shadow: add a box shadow and potentially translate box a little bit, on hover
- **swing/wiggle** back and forth (would be good for when you click on something that you can't click on). need to set keyframes storing translations back and forth.
- adding an inset border with box-shadow with inset parameter engaged
