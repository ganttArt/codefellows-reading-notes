## Read04: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### Duckett HTML/CSS Chapter 4: “Links” (pp.74-93)

- Use href in an `<a>` tag to define the destination of your link.
- relative links can be used in href='anotherpage.html'
- parent, child, grandparent, grandchild: relationships in file directory structure
- mailto:john@gmail.com, structure can be used in href to open the user's email program and start an email
- open link in a new window: target='_blank'
- linking to id in same page with href='#id'
  - can be used for external webpages too with the same formatting at the end.

### Duckett HTML/CSS Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)

- absolute, relative, fixed and floating positioning
- z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top when boxes overlap.
- relative: change the position of where something would be in 'normal-flow'. add top bottom left right properties to determine how far the object should be offset.
- float: allows you to place the box in an area you would want it in a container, everything else in the container will wrap around it accordingly
- p.370-376: in depth techniques for using float property.
- fixed width (tend to use pixels, less responsive) vs liquid layouts (tend to use %, change as user changes window size)
- css grid based layouts covered
- 2 ways to use multiple style sheets:
  - use multiple links in html
  - use @import url('styles.css'); in the css page you link.
