## Read02: Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

### Duckett HTML Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)

- text tags discussed: h1+, p, b(bold), i(italic)
- superscript `<sup>` and subscript `<sub>` used for things like mathematical notation. superscript raises the text and shrinks it, subscript does the same but lowers the text.
- white space collapsing: any whitespace over 1 space will be shrunk to 1 space.
- br and hr tags for newline and solid line break
- semantic tags:
  - `<strong>` will make text bold, means strong importance
  - `<em>` will make text italic, means emphasis
  - `<blockquote>` to site a quote. use a `<p>` tag inside this tag. and don't rely on this for quote styling, use css for that.
  - `<q>` for quote, will put quotations around text in a p.
  - `<abbr>` abbreviation
  - `<cite>` citation
  - `<dfn>` definition
  - `<address>` author details
  - `<ins>` underlines to show element has been added to document
  - `<del>` strikethrough to show text has been deleted
  - `<s>` strikethrough, shows element is no longer acurate or relevant
