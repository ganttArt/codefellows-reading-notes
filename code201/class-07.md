[Article on Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling) discusses:

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.
- Using a constructor to create object instances
- Generating a random number in JS
- Use small methods that focus on doing one job well.
