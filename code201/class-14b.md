- Julia Rozovsky, finds success in business school being part of a team that makes jokes and enjoys each other's company, while struggles on a team where peple are jockeying to be the best and make their mark.

- Psycologists fom several universitys studies groups and found:
  - on good teams, members spoke roughly in the same proportion, equality in conversational turn-taking
  - good teams had members who were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on the tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues
- Choose a free-flowing team over a serious-minded team. "Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking. Members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together."
- "On Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts."
- Psychological safety is important.
- For that we need to build bonds with our team and notice when something is going wrong for someone.
- Need to be able to be open and honest at work.
- Don't put on a work face, just be yourself.
