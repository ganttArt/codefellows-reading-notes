# Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

Markdown is a language where you can use a variety of basic symbols to create a simple webpage.

Basic Syntax includes: Headdrs, Italics, Bold, Unordered and Ordered Lists, Images, Links, Quotes and Inline Code.

Github has it's own Markdown syntax that expands on the basic markdown syntax. This includes syntax highlighting to format code that you're referencing and mentioning people you want to see the document.

A guide on markdown for GitHub is [here.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## GitHub pages

GitHub pages is an easy way to create a webpage using markdown. You can enable a github page by going to settings and turning that feature on, the page will show the information from your repo's README.md file.

Github leverages Jekyll to give github pages styled themes. You can choose a theme in the repo settings under github pages and when you enable this feature, github will create a config.yml file in your repo that stores the jekyll theme information. The theme will not be reflected in the repo README, but it will be reflected in the github pages website corresponding.
