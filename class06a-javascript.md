- shorthand for creating a bunch of variables is using one line to declare the variables  
`var price, quantity, total;`  
and then assigning values to each of the variables on separate lines.
- variables can be used to store references to html elements  
`var el = document.getElementById('cost')`
- `===` checks value and data, called `strictly equals`
  - can add `"use strict"` at top of javascript page to have javascript executed in strict mode.
