## What makes a computer a computer?

- Machines designed to help with mental labor as opposed to manual labor. Computers deal in infomation labor.
- 4 common things: Input, Storage, Processing, Output

## Binary & Data

- Bit: Smallest piece of information a computer can store.
  - It's 1 or 0.
  - 1 wire can store 1 bit, and that increases exponentially with more wires.

- Binary Number System
  - b1001 == 9
    - each position represents a value
    - (1x8) + (0x4) + (0x2) + (1x1)
  - each letter will have a number to represent it and the binary to represent that number
  - every thing on a computer is binary behind the scenes.

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

- User input -> Binary -> CPU -> Memory -> Output

## Extra:

xor: Exclusive Or. Outputs true only when the inputs differ.
