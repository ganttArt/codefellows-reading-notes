# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

- In 1984 the percentage of women in computer science flattened an then dropped. This came after a time the percentage of women in cs were growing faster than any other demographic and many of the pioneers in cs were women.
- Why might this have happenend? No clear one answer
  - The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. These were primarily marketed to boys.
  - Boys got computers more than women and later, college students were expected to know how to use a computer
