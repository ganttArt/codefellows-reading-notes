# Class 7 - REST & APIs

## [A Conversation about REST with my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

- Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser (HTTP)
- http is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
- The web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
- We need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine. The answer is “Web Services” or "APIs".
- The URL is so important because it let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's data
- GET PUT DELETE are universal ways to deal with information on APIs
- HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns, applying GET/PUT/DELETE
- When a machine GETs the resource, it will ask for the machine readable one. When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human readable one.
- to do a partial update, there's PATCH
