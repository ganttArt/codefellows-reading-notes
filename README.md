# CodeFellows Reading Notes
## Growth Mindset
**Growth mindset** is a way of thinking that lean towards the belief that you will grow through learning, as opposed to a fixed mindset that rests on *flawed premis* that we are uncapable of becoming more than what we currently are. 

A great resource for learning about Growth Mindset can be found [here.](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)

### How can I keep myself in a growth mindset?
1. When receiving criticism, face it and focus on learning from it instead of ignoring it.
1. When a challenge arises, instead of avoiding it in fear, dive right on in and face it.
1. When you see the success of others, don't view it as a threat, model their success as something to be inspired by.
